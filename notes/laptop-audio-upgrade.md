# Laptop Upgrade Guide for Low-Latency Audio

Research for replacing Dell Inspiron 14 5425 (AMD Ryzen 5) with a laptop suitable for low-latency audio work (software pedals via Ableton + Focusrite Scarlett).

## Use Case

**Primary:**
- Bass cover production (hobby) - see [media.md](media.md)
- Software pedals: Ableton + Focusrite Scarlett, low-latency monitoring

**Secondary:**
- Side project development
- Light web browsing

**Not needed:**
- Gaming
- GPU-intensive workloads
- High-end graphics

**Implication:** Integrated graphics (Intel UHD/Iris) is preferred - avoids discrete GPU DPC issues entirely. Opens up lighter, more portable options.

## Why Current Laptop Doesn't Work

See [audio-latency.md](audio-latency.md) for full investigation. Summary:
- Dell Inspiron (2022) + AMD Ryzen 5 has audio glitches at 128-sample buffer
- LatencyMon shows acceptable DPC latency, but glitches persist
- Same setup worked fine on older Intel Dell laptop
- Likely a Dell/AMD-specific driver or firmware issue

## What Makes a Laptop Good for Audio

### DPC Latency
The most critical factor for real-time audio. DPC (Deferred Procedure Call) latency determines if the system can process audio buffers without dropouts.

- **< 500µs** - Excellent, no issues at any buffer size
- **500µs - 1ms** - Good, works well at 128+ samples
- **> 1ms** - Problematic, may need 256+ buffer or cause glitches

### Key Specs

| Spec | Recommendation | Notes |
|------|----------------|-------|
| CPU | Intel preferred for low-latency | AMD catches up at higher buffer sizes but less efficient at 64-128 samples |
| GPU | Intel integrated or AMD discrete | NVIDIA drivers known to cause DPC issues |
| RAM | 16GB minimum | 32GB for large projects |
| Storage | NVMe SSD | For sample streaming |
| Ports | Thunderbolt/USB-C | Low-latency audio interface connection |
| Thermals | Quiet under load | Fan noise during recording is a dealbreaker |

### Intel vs AMD for Audio

**Intel advantages:**
- More efficient at low buffer sizes (64-128 samples)
- Better tested USB/audio stack
- Historically fewer DPC latency issues

**AMD considerations:**
- Performs well at 256+ buffer sizes
- Newer Ryzen generations improved significantly
- Mobile Ryzen (laptops) more problematic than desktop
- Power management more aggressive, can cause latency spikes

**Verdict:** For low-latency software monitoring (your use case), Intel is safer. AMD desktop can work, AMD mobile (laptops) is riskier.

### NVIDIA GPU Warning

NVIDIA GPU drivers (`nvlddmkm.sys`) are notorious for causing DPC latency issues. Options:
1. Choose laptop with Intel integrated or AMD discrete GPU
2. If NVIDIA, may need to disable GPU or use minimal driver install

## Platform Options

### Option 1: Windows Laptop (Recommended Path)

Keeps your current workflow (Ableton, Windows setup documented in this repo).

**Pros:**
- Familiar ecosystem
- Ableton + VST plugins work
- Can migrate your existing Windows setup

**Cons:**
- DPC latency varies by laptop model
- Need to research specific models carefully
- "Modern Standby" on newer laptops complicates audio optimization

### Option 2: MacBook (Not Considering)

Documented for completeness, but **not a viable option** - staying in Windows/Linux ecosystem.

<details>
<summary>Details (for reference)</summary>

**Pros:**
- Core Audio built into OS - ultra-low latency out of the box
- No ASIO driver complexity
- M-series chips extremely efficient (30% CPU with full session)
- Focusrite Scarlett works natively
- "It just works" reputation for audio

**Cons:**
- Different OS, learning curve
- Some Windows-only VST plugins won't work
- Higher cost
- Locked into Apple ecosystem

**Latency comparison:**
- MacBook M-series + Scarlett: ~16ms round-trip at 128 samples (comparable to Windows)
- Main advantage is reliability, not raw latency numbers

</details>

### Option 3: Specialist Audio Laptop (XMG)

XMG (German company) sells laptops specifically optimized for audio:
- DPC latency tested and guaranteed < 1ms out of the box
- Bloatware-free Windows install
- BIOS and drivers tuned for audio

**Pricing:**
- XMG DJ 15 base: ~€1,100-1,220
- XMG DJ 15 max: ~€1,500
- (Comparable to MacBook Air M4)

**Pros:**
- Purpose-built, guaranteed low latency
- No configuration/troubleshooting needed

**Cons:**
- **Dated hardware** - XMG DJ 15 uses Intel 10th gen (2020), no updates since
- Only available in Europe (shipping to Japan?)
- Paying premium for 5-year-old specs
- XMG's 2024-2025 focus shifted to gaming laptops with NVIDIA GPUs

**Verdict:** Not recommended. Same €1,100-1,500 gets you Intel 13th/14th gen, DDR5, Thunderbolt 4 in a modern ultrabook. The DPC guarantee doesn't justify 5-year-old specs - just verify DPC on NotebookCheck before buying.

## Specific Recommendations

Given the lightweight use case (no gaming/GPU needs), prioritize:
- Intel CPU with integrated graphics (Iris Xe or UHD)
- Portable form factor (13-15")
- Good keyboard for dev work
- Quiet thermals

### Recommended Categories

| Category | Examples | Notes |
|----------|----------|-------|
| Business ultrabook | ThinkPad T series, X series | Good keyboards, Intel options, check specific model DPC |
| Used workstation | ThinkPad P52 | Known good DPC, overkill specs but reliable |

### Models to Research

| Model | Why | Check |
|-------|-----|-------|
| ThinkPad T14s (Intel) | Portable, business-class | NotebookCheck DPC, avoid AMD variant |
| ThinkPad X1 Carbon (Gen 9+) | Ultralight, Intel | Verify DPC on specific gen |
| Used ThinkPad P52 | Known good, budget option | Availability |

**Avoid:**
- ThinkPad P53, X1 Extreme Gen 2 (known DPC issues)
- Dell XPS series (ACPI.sys issues)
- Any AMD mobile CPU (based on current experience)
- Discrete NVIDIA GPU models

## Research Resources

4. **Individual reviews** - Look for LatencyMon results in detailed reviews

## Decision Framework

```
Is low-latency software monitoring the primary goal?
├─ Yes (Windows only)
│  ├─ Standard laptop (new)?
│  │  ├─ Check NotebookCheck DPC ranking for candidates
│  │  ├─ Prefer Intel CPU + integrated graphics (avoid NVIDIA)
│  │  └─ Search forums for real-world audio reports
│  └─ Used/older option? → ThinkPad P52 (known good)
└─ No (can use higher buffer/direct monitoring)
   └─ Current laptop may be acceptable with workarounds
```

## Action Items

- [ ] Check NotebookCheck DPC ranking for candidate models
- [ ] Search forums for real-world audio experiences with specific models
- [ ] Define budget range
